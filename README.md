# Assignment reflection

- Didn't love that it was a one-day thing with little prospect of help, made me not want to bother asking and I would have liked some direct guidance regarding Tiptap, and I gave up on that after getting frustrated at trying to find something to reference for it.

# Requirements

Were there any requirement laid out for this one other than "fork a repo and deploy to vercel"? Anyway, that's been done.

I also added some error handling to Vote.jsx and AddPost, added post titles to the metadata, and un-commented the line of SQL that causes the entire database to break, but on its own implements one like-per-user (was it meant to be deleted?).

I added a basic user page, but did nothing with it really.

I might have tried some more stretch goals, but I really did spend a lot of time trying to find something to help me with Tiptap and the form-submit process and everything I found I didn't really understand, and before I knew it I was looking at 3PM with nothing to show for it.

# Thoughts

I like the idea of a one-day challenge with smaller goals and stakes, but with less direct help - but I don't think you can just drop it on our heads like that. I had (past tense, haven't had it at time of this Readme haha) a doctor's appointment today after class, if I had done it during the morning then suddenly I would have missed crucial time.
